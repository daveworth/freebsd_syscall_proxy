# freebsd_syscall_proxy

A syscall-proxy written for FreeBSD

## From a time when shellcode meant something...
... and exploits were free, and assembly was still exciting, and hyperbole ran
down from the mountains in streams of prose, comes a very out-dated, likely to
no-longer compile, chunk of C and assembly which proxies syscalls to far-away
lands.

I toiled and crafted this code, and realized massive design flaws later, but boy
was it fun to write.
